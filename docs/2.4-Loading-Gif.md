# 2.4 Installing: Loading GIF

Squirrel installers don't have any UI - the goal of a Squirrel installer is to install so blindingly fast that double-clicking on Setup.exe *feels* like double-clicking on an app shortcut. Make your installer **fast**.

However, for large applications, this isn't possible. For these apps, Squirrel will optionally display a graphic as a "splash screen" while installation is processing, but only if installation takes more than a pre-set amount of time. This will be centered, backed by a transparent window, and can optionally be an animated GIF. Specify this via the `-g` parameter.

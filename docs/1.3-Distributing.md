# 1.3 Distributing

After packaging MyApp for distribution, the various files in the `Releases` directory are used to distribute MyApp to users. 
 
* **Setup Application** - the `Setup.exe` application is provided to new users to install the current version of MyApp (see [1.4 Installing](1.4-Installing.md)). 
* **Update Files** - the `RELEASES` file, along with versioned full and delta packages, are used by the update process (see [1.4 Updating](1.4-Updating.md)).  

## Local File Distribution

For simplicity, this Getting Started guide uses a local file system location for updates. The location is defined in the update location provided to the `UpdateManager` (see code in [1.1.2 Basic Updating](1.1-Integrating.md)).

This generally is not practical for updates, unless all your users have access to similar network path where the files could be easily placed.  

## Additional Distribution Options

Section [2.3 More Distributing](2.3-More-Distributing.md) will go over using alternate sources to serve your application packages, including the following:

* Microsoft IIS
* GitHub
* Amazon S3
